    <h1> About Me </h1>
    
    <p> I am deeply drawn to the idea of multi-disciplinary research that can especially solve a societal problem. My interests in public health stems from my childhood days where I aspired to become a doctor that with maturity shaped into becoming a tech enthusiast who could aid doctors and effectively analyse the medical and epidemiological data. While I am strengthening my domain knowledge in public health, I have a diverse tech background, highlights being: 

      <ul>
        <li>Python, Basic Java, C/C++, MATLAB, SQL</li>
        <li>Machine Learning </li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
        <li>Image Processing </li>
        <li>Biomedical Signal Processing</li>
        <li>Deep Learning </li>
        <li>Hardware coding using arduino and raspberry pi</li>
I am always curious to learn more of concepts and algorithms in machine learning and observe its application in various fields. </p>

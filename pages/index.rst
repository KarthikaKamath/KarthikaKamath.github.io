	<p class="lead"> Hi! I am Karthika Kamath. I am 25 years old and over these years I have developed interest in multiple things. Which is why I am a strong believer of diversification in not just your investment portfolio but in everthing in life. I love multi than uni and I do believe we are a part of multiverse. You will also see me do multitasking more often than not.</p>
	<p class="lead"> I am currently working in Fractal Analytics in the team Fractal Cerebral, building a new capability of Neuroscience+AI for the firm. Previously at Fractal I have helped my clients make data driven decisions in the digital marketing domain. And prior to that I have also worked as a software developer in UBS where I was working in the credit risk domain. But the domain I am really passionate about is healthtech and more precisely I am deeply drawn to the idea of multi-disciplinary research that can solve a neuroscience problem.</p>
	<p class="lead"> I am an active learner and observer. I love discussing algorithms in data science. I am also involved in building a data science community to educate people in this field. I like to start my day with Hackernews.</p>
	<p class="lead"> For relaxing I dance and choreograph :)</p>
